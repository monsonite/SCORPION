# SCORPION

A minimalist 8-bit "TTL" microcomputer based on a bit-serial ALU.

SCORPION is the 4th of my arachnid themed, acronymically named, bit-serial microcomputer designs, following on from the TICK, MITE and SPIDER bit-serial testbed tesigns.

Serial Computer Operating Reduced Parallel Interpreted Opcode Nemonics

SCORPION will be the test bed for implementing the human readable MINT bytecode language and interpreter on dedicated TTL hardware.
